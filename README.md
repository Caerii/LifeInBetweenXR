## What it does

Our mixed reality experience, "Life in Between," allows users to view hyper-local environments around them using 3D mesh data of local buildings. By providing detailed information about the places around them, we aim to enhance people's sense of presence and connection to their community. Users can explore their neighborhood, discover new places and learn more about the history and architecture of the buildings around them.
Our experience can be used for a variety of purposes, including: 
- Community building
- Tourism and local discovery
- Educational and historical exploration 
- Real estate and property management
